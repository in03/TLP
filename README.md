## Enough is enough üò§

It's time that to-do list apps were more useful than frontend proof-of-concept demo apps or hyperscaler-harvesting-spyware: 
- *"Try my blazing fast JS framework's demo to-do app! Add some tasks, drag them around, tick them off. See?"* ü§Æ **YUCK** 
- *"Yes, you can embed images in the task notes. No, you **must** grant permissions to your whole image library or it won't work.* ü§¨ **DISGUST**

## Solution? 

**Use TLP: To-Do List Protocol!** üìùüöÄ

Take the power back ‚úä‚ö°Ô∏è

- Want to send secure messages to your friends? Use TLP! ‚õìÔ∏èüôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
- Want a secure tunnel to hide your Web traffic from your ISP? TLP! üö´üïµ
- Want to benchmark your new blazing-fast Javascript framework's to-do list demo app? USE IT! üë®‚Äçüíª
- Want to experience the modern web on a connection slower than dial-up? LOOK NO FURTHER! üêå

> [!CAUTION]
> While every care has been taken to configure defaults to work within the service agreements of third-party to-do list applications, you are free at any time to drop the gutter guards and run the protocol in all its extreme-overhead glory. Doing so will likely get you kicked, banned or sent a nasty email. You are responsible for your own decisions. If you're curious but ~~masochistic~~ legally-conscious, you can always spin up your own self-hosted to-do list and spam yourself.

## How it Works
TLP unnecessarily re-implements the **transport layer** and "sort of" some of the **application layer** of the OSI stack.

**TLP Transport Layer:**
- Reliability
- Segmentation
- Acknowledgment
- Retransmission

**TLP Application Layer:**
- To do list app is technically user facing, I guess.
- Make use of to-do application logic to determine transport layer.
- You could do stuff here but anything beyond looking would result in corruption.


## Features
- Supports unicast through task assignment.
- Supports multicast through shared task lists (Microsoft and Todoist)
- Monitoring built in! Watch your packets arrive and "complete" in real time. 
- Multiple adapters for your favourite To-Do list apps
  - [ ] [Microsoft To Do](https://to-do.office.com/tasks/) (API)
  - [ ] [Todoist](https://todoist.com/home) (API)
  - [ ] [Habitica](https://habitica.com/) (API üêå)
  - [ ] [LiveView-Svelte-PWA](https://github.com/thisistonydang/liveview-svelte-pwa) (Selenium)

> [!NOTE] 
> Sensible defaults are configured to align with rate-limits where specified.
> üêå denotes particularly slow rate limits. *Habitica*, for example, mandates 30 seconds between each API call.
